# About

I created Free Time SF because I believe that the best way to improve our city is to have everyone
contribute in some way. 

. When I look around I see homelessness, litter, disappearing culture, underfunded schools, etc. And yet, I was spending most of my time thinking about solutions to problems that would help make a company more money, but would not better society in any meaningful way.

I was fortunate to have some savings built up and decided to take some time off work. In my free time I started tutoring with a program called Breakthrough SF. I have found this extremely rewarding and meaningful.

In talking to more friends about my situation, I found that I am not the only one who feels this way. Free Time SF is an attempt to unlock some of this potential. I think we can setup a system in which everyone wins. Organizations can tap into a larger pool of highly skilled, motivated volunteers. Volunteers can apply their skills to solve problems in their city, while also making friends and gaining experience.

Thanks for

at web development, I'd love the help. All the code is open source on GitHub https://github.com/johndoherty/freetimesf.
