# About

## Why

I created Free Time SF because I noticed that work was feeling empty, despite paying well, offering nice perks, and keeping my brain occupied. When I look around I see homelessness, litter, disappearing culture, underfunded schools, etc. And yet, I was spending most of my time thinking about solutions to problems that would help make a company more money, but would not better society in any meaningful way.

I was fortunate to have some savings built up and decided to take some time off work. In my free time I started tutoring with a program called Breakthrough SF. I have found this extremely rewarding and meaningful.

In talking to more friends about my situation, I found that I am not the only one who feels this way. Free Time SF is an attempt to unlock some of this potential. I think we can setup a system in which everyone wins. Organizations can tap into a larger pool of highly skilled, motivated volunteers. Volunteers can apply their skills to solve problems in their city, while also making friends and gaining experience.


## How?

If you are interested in getting involved you can complete the survey. This will include information like availability, interests, and skills. The data from this survey will be made anonomous and public for organizers to use to plan events. Organizers will send us information about their volunteer opportunites, which we will aggregate and send out in a personalized email every week.
