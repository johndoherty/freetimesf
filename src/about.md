# About

## Mission

I created Free Time SF because I believe the answers to a lot of our city's problems lie in people taking ownership of their community. San Francisco faces complex challenges, but it is also home to a lot of very smart, motivated people. By connecting those interested in improving their community with leaders working to solve these problems, we can start making progress.

I believe the pool of interested volunteers is much larger than most people realize.  People are always looking to make friends and work on projects that have a positive impact. Voluntering can fill this need for a lot of people.

Similarly, many organizations could benefit from more help. While larger nonprofits have the resources to take on new volunteers and provide a structured volunteer experience, anyone can be a leader in the community. All it takes is an idea, some motivation, and a little help.

By making it easier to get involved as a volunteer or an organizer, I hope to tap into a larger pool of people interested in improving San Francisco.

## My Story

My name is John Doherty. I've lived in the Bay Area for about 6 years and in San Francisco for the last two. I've worked at tech companies for a few years, and while I appreciated making a good salary and enjoyed the perks, I couldn't help but feel something was missing.

I left my job and spent some time traveling and visiting friends and family. I also  volunteered as a tutor for Breakthrough SF. I found tutoring to be incredibly rewarding, which was one of the motivations for creating Free Time SF.

## Contributing

As you may have noticed, I'm not a web developer. If you have some skills, or want to try your hand at web development, I'd love the help. All the code is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/johndoherty/freetimesf).
