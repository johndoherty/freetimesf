  The goal is to help you organize events that can tap into a larger pool of volunteers.

<p>
  This data is open to the public with the goal of helping anyone organize a volunteering event.
  Whether you are an established organization or an individual looking to improve your community,
  use this information to tap into a pool of people interested in volunteering.
