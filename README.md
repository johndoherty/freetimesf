# Free Time SF

This is the code for Free Time SF, a site designed to link up volunteers and organizations in San Francisco. We collect some information about interested volunteers through a survey. We aggregate that data and make it public to help guide organizers. Then we send volunteers a weekly newsletter with events and organizations that best match their preferences.

The code is made public to inspire trust in our operations and to serve as a starting point for anyone else trying to do something similar in other cities.
